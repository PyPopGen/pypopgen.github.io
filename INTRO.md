# Introduction

PopGen aims to generate data that predict realistic anatomical and physiological variation in human populations. Organ volumes and blood flows are determined for virtual individuals from both *a priori* distibutions of anthropometric parameters such as body mass, height, and body mass index, and from measured data from existing studies.

Calculations are based on algorithms developed by [Bayer Technology Services GmbH](https://www.bayer.com/en/pharma/technologies) and published in Willman et al (2007), Development of a Physiology-Based Whole-Body Population Model for Assessing the Influence of Individual Variability on the Pharmacokinetics of Drugs. *Journal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics* **34**, 401-431.
