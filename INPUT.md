## What is Body Mass Index?

Body Mass Index (BMI, defined as mass in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres, kg/m²) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify underweight, overweight and obesity in adults. BMI values are age-independent and the same for both sexes. The [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/) recommends that countries use all categories (i.e. 18.5, 23, 25, 27.5, 30, 32.5 kg/m², and in many populations, 35, 37.5, and 40 kg/m². [[BMI Classification](http://www.who.int/bmi/index.jsp?introPage=intro_3.html)]

## What are the parameters for enzyme rate?

Enzyme rate of metabolism is specified using one of these parameters:

- V<sub>max</sub> — maximum initial velocity of reaction, pmol/min/mg micro protein
- CL<sub>int</sub> — intrinsic hepatic clearance, mL/min/μg micro protein

## What is a seed?

An initial value used to generate pseudorandom numbers. If you supply a seed value, your population can be regenerated at a later time by supplying the same seed value.

## About population types

The population type option affects how ages, heights, and body weights are sampled. Realistic populations are designed to roughly mimic real human demographics whereas high variation populations contain people with more extreme characteristics and are better for stress-testing PBPK models.
